# ASEP-FY-SEM-1-Project
A web-based tool called NGO Finder makes it simple for users to locate and get in touch with NGOs. It offers a straightforward and engaging interface where users may examine NGO details, missions, and contact details. It was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is made to be user-friendly and responsive, guaranteeing seamless navigation across a range of devices. To make the platform more useful and accessible in the future, we intend to include features like real-time updates, multilingual support and a mobile app.

Why NGO Finder?
<br>
Due to changing economical and social conditions many people in the society are facing problems in their life. So to solve them we decided to make a medium through which they can avail facilities like education, shelter, food, etc…
<br>
<ol>
      <li>We looked for the NGO websites available currently. They are also good but we saw that they are more complicated for new users or the people who don’t have much knowledge about technology but they want help from NGO’s.</li>
      <li>The Government website provides the information but it is somewhat outdated like contact details and address.</li>
      <li>Our main motive is to provide users with a easy and helpful tool for getting connected to NGO’s.</li>
